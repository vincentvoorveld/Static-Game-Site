Build a very simple browser game as a 100% static site (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only; no backend, no external libraries). The game must run by opening index.html directly and must work when hosted on GitHub Pages.

Game concept:
- The player is a “salesperson” represented by a simple character icon.
- The player collects items that fall from the top of the screen:
  1) Coins labeled “3C” (good)
  2) Quotes (good)
  3) Banknotes (good)
- The player must avoid “Distractions” (bad items) such as:
  - Meeting
  - Spam
  - No-show
  - Admin work

Very simple gameplay:
- The player moves left and right to catch items.
- Controls:
  - Desktop: Left and Right arrow keys
  - Mobile: On-screen left and right buttons OR touch dragging
- Items fall continuously from the top of the screen.
- Scoring:
  - “3C” coin: +3 points
  - Quote: +10 points
  - Banknote: +25 points
- Catching a bad item costs 1 life.
- Missing a good item has no penalty.
- The player starts with 3 lives.
- When lives reach 0, the game ends.

Difficulty and progression:
- Every 20 seconds, slightly increase the falling speed and spawn rate.
- Show a “Level” indicator that increases with difficulty.

Visual style (keep it clean and minimal):
- Use an HTML5 Canvas OR simple DOM elements (choose the simplest approach).
- Background: simple office-themed colors.
- Item visuals:
  - 3C coin: round, yellow-ish, text “3C”
  - Quote: paper-like rectangle, text “Quote”
  - Banknote: green rectangle, “€” symbol
  - Bad items: red-ish rectangles with their label
- Add small, subtle animations (for example, a tiny bounce when an item is caught).

User interface:
- Top bar showing:
  - Score
  - Lives (heart icons)
  - Level
  - Control hint: “← → to move”
- Start screen with:
  - Game title: “Sales Coin Catcher” (or similar)
  - A “Start” button
- Game Over overlay showing:
  - Final score
  - High score
  - “Restart” button

Project structure:
- /index.html
- /style.css
- /game.js
- No build step
- No npm
- No frameworks

Technical requirements:
- Use requestAnimationFrame for the game loop (if using Canvas).
- Make the game responsive and playable on different screen sizes.
- Use relative paths for all assets.
- Comment the code briefly and keep it easy to understand.

Extra:
- Save the best score using localStorage.
- Display the high score on the start screen and game over screen.

Documentation:
- Include a short README.md explaining:
  - How to run the game locally (open index.html)
  - How to deploy it using GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch)
